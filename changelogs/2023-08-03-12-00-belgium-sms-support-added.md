## We added support for sending Review Acquisition SMS campaigns to Belgium phone numbers

*   With this build, we will now be able to send SMSes to Belgium phone numbers that belong to Belgium locations in Synup. 
*   We use Twilio to send the SMS. 

> **📘**    INFO
>           Sending SMS to Belgium country has been enabled in Twilio. But, through Twilio, we          need to register for a number or an alphanumeric number using which our SMSes will be          sent. This is a regulation provided by the country which we need to complete as a process.
