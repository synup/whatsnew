*   A tweet with more than 280 characters will now be divided into multiple linked tweets that will look like a thread. 
*   If there are two parts then the first tweet will have this (1/2) and the second tweet will have (2/2) to determine which part of the tweet it is. 
*   Also, the second tweet will come as a reply to the first tweet.

> **ðŸ“˜**    INFO
>           We had implemented the direct integration for Twitter through our app, but like Aryshare, we did not have support for threads. So, Twitter direct was not released till we implemented this in Social.
